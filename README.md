### Heyo, I'm Josiah
You seem to have stumbled upon my GitHub profile. This is a bit awkward, but I really don't have anything nicely formatted here for you to see! I'd like to say it's because I don't have time, but let's be honest: it just hasn't been a priority. 

That said, I have worked on some fairly interesting stuff, so feel free to have a poke around. You may stumble upon something that strikes your fancy!

TLDR: 
- TypeScript
- CSS
- Tailwind
- React


I also dabble with:
- Homelabbing
  -   Home assistant
  -   Ad Blocker
  -   VPN
  -   OctoPrint
  -   DDNS
- 3D Printing


Also, if you stumble across any _really_ nice animations, they make me happy, so feel free to send them my way on the Twitters ([@josiahnunemaker](https://twitter.com/josiahnunemaker))
